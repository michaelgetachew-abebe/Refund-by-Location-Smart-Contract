## Web3: Refund by Location Smart Contract

## About
This project is about doing a refund by location smart contract that is aimed to be used when one party, for example an employer, agrees to pay another party, when an employee, for being present in a certain geographic area for a certain duration. The employee’s phone sends its GPS location to a smart contract at a certain interval. Based on the pre-agreed contract codified in an Ethereum smart contract, a cryptocurrency payment is executed when all the agreed conditions are met. If, at any point, the GPS sensor indicates that an employee is outside the range of the agreed GPS area, the contract state will be updated to indicate that it is out of compliance.
